    "\n",
    "> This problem consists of just a single exercise, worth ten (10) points. This problem is the second of many on the site [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net), a set of Number Theory-based computational problems. You might find some of the other problems to be fun challenges - but be warned, they scale up in difficulty quickly as you complete them!"
