    "You've used Python's `dict` data type extensively now. Recall that it maps keys to values. But how is it implemented under-the-hood? One way is via a classic computer science technique known as a **hash table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, a hash table has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A list of **buckets**. The buckets are stored in a Python `list` of a certain maximum size. Each bucket has a **bucket ID**, which is its position in the list of buckets. Each bucket is itself _another_ Python list, which will hold the values. But more on that detail later (under **Collisions**, below).\n",
    "2. A **hash function**, which converts any given key into the bucket ID in which it belongs. We'll sometimes refer to the output of the hash function as the **hash value** of the given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function is usually decomposed into two steps. The first step converts the key into some non-negative integer, which may be very large. So, we can take this large integer _modulo_ the number of buckets, to get a valid bucket ID. (Recall that $a$ modulo $b$ means the remainder after dividing $a$ by $b$, which in Python you can compute using the `%` operator.)"

    "In this problem, you will implement a hash table that maps names (the keys, given as strings) to phone numbers (the values). You may find it helpful to keep the following image in mind when reasoning about how a hash table works. First, suppose you have 16 `buckets`:\n",

    "\n",
    "Further suppose that the first step of our hash function calculates the value of 124,722 for the key, `John Smith`. We would then take this value `modulo 16`, the size of `buckets`, and are left with the bucket ID of `124722 % 16 == 2`. We put John's information in this bucket, which is location 2 in our list of buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the motivation for this scheme? **If** the hash function does a good job of spreading out keys among the buckets, then the average time it takes to find a value into the hash table will be proportional to the average bucket size, rather than being proportional to the size of the entire list. And if we have enough buckets, then each bucket will (hopefully) be small, so that searching the bucket will be fast even if we use brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *One detail.* Unlike the image above, in this problem you will store *both* the key and value into the hash table. That is, you will be inserting `(key, value)` pairs into the buckets, instead of just the value as shown in the illustration above."
